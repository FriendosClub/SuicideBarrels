Suicide Barrels
==============

Suicide Barrels is a gamemode for Garry's Mod 13. This is an updated version that I'm personally working on, based upon the following:   
* Heyo's original version for GMod 10 (<a href="http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=246017">found here</a>)   
* Zephruz's update for GMod 13 (<a href="http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1399537">found here</a>)   


The aim of this project is to create an updated version, fix bugs, and add features. Right now, it is very basic, and only sports few features. These include:
* 2 teams - Barrels and Humans
* Barrels can taunt (RMB) and explode (LMB)
* Humans can shoot their one gun (LMB), and reload it (R or RMB)
